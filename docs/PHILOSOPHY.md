# RS Protocol Philosophy

## Core Principles

### 1. Fair Launch via Dutch Auction
- No privileged early access
- Price discovery through market dynamics
- Equal opportunity participation
- Prevents whale manipulation
- Inspired by Andre Cronje's fair launch principles

### 2. Retroactive Rewards for Positive Behavior
- First airdrop (7M) recognizes historical support
- Second airdrop (7M) rewards demonstrated protocol loyalty
- Behavior-based rather than simple token holdings
- Rewards actions over promises

### 3. Options as Behavioral Incentives

- Exercise windows encourage sustained participation
- Rewards conviction and commitment
